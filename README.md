# TapePilot – Transport & Capstan Simulator

TapePilot is a **visual and interactive simulator** for tape recorder transport systems,
focused on **capstan control**, **encoder feedback**, and **real-time fault injection**.

The simulator models physical components such as reels, capstan, pinch roller, and tape path,
using **SVG-based mechanics**, while plotting control signals and system response live.

> This project is part of an experimental effort to modernize and prototype tape transport
control systems using contemporary software techniques.
